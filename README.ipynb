        "# Problem Statement:\n",
        "The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data extraction**:  Cloning the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data transformation**: Using a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Database insertion**: Use the \"mysql-connector-python\" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dashboard creation**: Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data retrieval**: Using the \"mysql-connector-python\" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe and Using the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.\n",
